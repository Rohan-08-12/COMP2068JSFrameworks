        <h2>What you need to know about spa!</h2>
        <p>
          A spa is a location where mineral-rich spring water (and sometimes
          seawater) is used for medicinal baths. Spa towns or spa resorts
          typically offer various health treatments (balneotherapy). The belief
          in the curative powers of mineral waters goes back to prehistoric
          times. Such practices have been popular worldwide, especially in
          Europe and Japan. Day spas are also popular and offer various personal
          care treatments.

        <h3 id="origins">Origins of the term</h3>
        <p>
          The term is derived from the town of Spa, Belgium, known since Roman
          times as Aquae Spadanae. Some connect it with the Latin
          <em>spargere</em> (“to sprinkle or moisten”). Others suggest it comes
          from the Belgian town where a curative natural spring was discovered
          in the 14th century.

          A body or spa treatment is a non-medical procedure to support the

          spa, day spa, beauty salon, or school.
